## Instructions For Fraction Collection Unit

1. Build the Creality Ender 5 S1 3D Printer according to the supplied instructions.
2. Download the [CAD Files](../CAD).
3. Download [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) to slice the stl files and generate the G-code for printing.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Once printing is complete, the print head is going to be removed from the printer so you might want to print a few spare sets before taking this step.

Assemble the Capillary Bracket.

## Usage:
1. Run the GUI.py file
2. Press the home button before running the fraction collection sequence.


ðŸ’¡ **Note:** It is worth creating a desktop launcher for GUI.py. This will allow the machine to be controlled completely through the touchscreen.
