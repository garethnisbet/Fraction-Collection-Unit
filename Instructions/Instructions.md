## Instructions For Fraction Collection Unit

1. Build the Creality Ender 5 S1 3D Printer according to the supplied instructions.

2. Download the [CAD Files](../CAD).
3. Download [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) to slice the stl files and generate the G-code for printing.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Once printing is complete, the print head is going to be removed from the printer so you might want to print a few spare sets before taking this step.

Assemble the Capillary Bracket.

Remove the print head hotplate and wiring (everything unplugs so no cutting is required).

Bolt the capillary bracket to print head plate.

[Install Software](../Python/) - Copy python files into a folder on the Raspberry Pi and run GUI.py.

* The home button homes the motors of the unit
* The dottted grid is used to select the well type. Each type will only fit in the unit one way
* The arrow buttons allow the stages to be jogged
* The stop button is to cancel a motion
* The play button will start the programmed sequence
* The trigger button will start the programmed sequence once a TTL pulse is received
* The save button will save the current position as the origin of the well unit (Note the depth will be relative to this origin)
* The gear button will take you to the settings page

* Pitch is the distance between the centre of two wells
* Depth sets the depth the capillary will travel relative to the origin
* Dwell Time is the time the unit will hold the capillary in the well
* Dwell Time (Sweep) is the time the unit will hold between iterations
* Speed sets the general travel speed of the unit

* Starting Well allows the user to choose a starting well other than the first well
* Number of Wells allows the user to limit the number of wells in the sequence
* Number of Iterations is the number of times the sequence is repeated 

## Usage:
1. Run the GUI.py file
2. Press the home button before running the fraction collection sequence.


ðŸ’¡ **Note:** It is worth creating a desktop launcher for GUI.py. This will allow the machine to be controlled completely through the touchscreen.
