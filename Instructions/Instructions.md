[Install Software](../Python/) - Copy python files into a folder and run GUI.py.



## Usage:
1. Run the GUI.py file
2. Press the home button before running the fraction collection sequence.


ðŸ’¡ **Note:** It is worth creating a desktop launcher for GUI.py. This will allow the machine to be controlled completely through the touchscreen.
